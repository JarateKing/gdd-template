# Game Design Document Template

This is intended to be a template for game design documents, as a starting point for designing a game, written in LaTeX. On top of providing additional utilities for writing GDDs, sections are provided as an example and may be modified or reordered as needed.
## How to Compile

This uses the LaTeX package [minted](https://github.com/gpoore/minted) and as such requires the python module `Pygments` (installable with `pip install Pygments`), and that compiling of the document requires the `--shell-escape` flag.
